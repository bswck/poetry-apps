> [!Note]
> If you use Windows, it is highly recommended to complete the installation in the way presented below through [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).



1.  Fork the [poetry-pipx repository](https://github.com/bswck/poetry-pipx) on GitHub.

1.  [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).<br/>
    Poetry is an amazing tool for managing dependencies & virtual environments, building packages and publishing them.
    You might use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#readme) to install it globally (recommended):

    ```shell
    pipx install poetry
    ```

    <sub>If you encounter any problems, refer to [the official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.</sub>

    If you want to use pipx to install dev dependencies as well, install the [export plugin](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-export#readme):
    ```shell
    pipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-export poetry-pipx
    ```

    Be sure to have Python 3.8 installed‚Äîif you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), simply run:

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.8
    ```

1.  Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/poetry-pipx path/to/poetry-pipx
    cd path/to/poetry-pipx
    poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
    ```

    If you use pipx, run the following command to install dev dependencies globally:
    ```shell
    poetry install --without=dev
    poetry pipx install dev
    ```
    Otherwise, run:

    ```shell
    poetry install
    ```
    Next up, simply activate the virtual environment and install pre-commit hooks:

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```
